# Shop Page Nostr Implementation - Fresh Blueprint

## Overview

This document provides a **clean, standardized blueprint** for implementing a Nostr-native shop page that allows users to create and display products using Kind 23 events with Blossom file storage.

## Core Requirements

### User Flow
**User with Signer** → **Creates product form** → **Uploads image to Blossom** → **Creates Kind 23 event** → **Signer signs event** → **Publishes to all configured relays** → **Shows "X of Y published" status** → **Product appears in shop**

### Relay Strategy
- **Publish to all configured relays** with full transparency (configurable: 1, 6, or 10 relays)
- **Show "X of Y published"** progress to give users confidence
- **Three retries per relay** to handle temporary network issues
- **Minimum 1 successful publish** required for success
- **Maintain decentralized resilience** through multiple relay publishing

### Relay Configuration
**Source**: Relay configuration imported from cbc3 project
**Relays**: 6 high-reliability relays configured
- wss://relay.damus.io (Damus Relay)
- wss://nos.lol (Nos.lol)
- wss://relay.snort.social (Snort Social)
- wss://relay.nostr.band (Nostr.band)
- wss://relay.primal.net (Primal)
- wss://offchain.pub (Offchain Pub)

**Configuration**: Production relays from beginning, no hardcoded relays in code

### Blossom File Storage Configuration
**Protocol**: Blossom decentralized file storage ([GitHub](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom))
**Authentication**: Kind 24242 (Authorization event) - Signed Nostr events prove identity
**File Identification**: SHA-256 hash-based addressing
**Redundancy**: Multiple server distribution with mirroring support
**API Endpoints**:
- `PUT /upload` - Upload blobs (requires signed Nostr event auth)
- `GET /<sha256>` - Retrieve blob by hash (with optional `.ext`)
- `HEAD /<sha256>` - Check if blob exists
- `GET /list/<pubkey>` - List user's blobs (optional auth)
- `DELETE /<sha256>` - Delete blob (requires signed auth)
- `PUT /mirror` - Mirror blobs to other servers
- `PUT /media` - Media optimization (strips metadata per BUD-05)
**File Size Limit**: 100MB per file
**Retry Logic**: 3 attempts per server
**Production Status**: Already integrated in Primal 2.2+, 206 stars, actively maintained

### Blossom Protocol Details (BUDs)
**BUDs (Blossom Upgrade Documents)**: Short documents outlining additional features
**Relevant BUDs for Shop Implementation**:
- **BUD-01**: Server requirements and blob retrieval
- **BUD-02**: Blob upload and management
- **BUD-04**: Mirroring blobs (redundancy)
- **BUD-05**: Media optimization (strips metadata for privacy)
- **BUD-06**: Upload requirements
- **BUD-08**: Nostr File Metadata Tags
- **BUD-09**: Blob Report

**Event Kinds Used**:
- **Kind 24242**: Authorization event (for all Blossom operations)
- **Kind 10063**: User Server List (for server discovery)

### Authentication Configuration
**Primary Method**: NIP-07 Browser Extension
**Future Methods**: NSEC private key, NIP-46 remote signing
**Signer Detection**: Automatic detection of available signers
**Event Signing**: All events signed before publishing to relays
**User Context**: Public key and signer capabilities tracked

### User Experience - Signer Detection
**Assumption**: Users have already installed and configured Nostr signer extension
**No Signer Detected**: Show clear message "No signer detected - please install Nostr signer"
**Signer Status Indicator**: Always visible showing "Connected: [Signer Name]" or "No signer detected"
**User Flow**: Signer detection happens automatically on page load

### User Experience - Product Creation (Standard Shop Practices)
**Form Display**: Modal overlay (standard e-commerce pattern)
**Image Upload**: Click to browse + drag & drop (standard file upload)
**Image Preview**: Show thumbnail before upload (standard UX)
**Custom Tags**: Comma-separated input field (simple, lightweight)
**Publishing Process**: 
- Disable form during upload/publishing
- Show progress: "Uploading image..." → "Publishing to relays (X of Y)..."
- Success: "Product published! Event ID: [eventid]"
- Error: "Publishing failed: [error details] - Retry"
**Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS
**Nostr Ethos**: Decentralized, user-controlled, transparent operations

### User Experience - Product Display (Simple & Scalable)
**Layout**: Card-based grid design (standard e-commerce)
**Product Cards**: All details shown in card (no modals/popups)
**Card Content**: Image, title, description, price, tags, seller info
**Interactions**: Click to view full details (expand card or inline)
**Loading States**: Skeleton cards during product loading
**Empty States**: "No products found" with call-to-action
**Search/Filter**: Not implemented initially (add when scaling)
**Responsive**: Mobile-first grid that adapts to screen size
**Nostr Ethos**: All product data from relays, no central database

### User Experience - Error Handling & Success Feedback
**Image Upload Failures**:
- Retry 3 times automatically before showing failure
- Technical error messages logged to console for debugging
- User sees: "Image upload failed after 3 attempts - please try again"
- Console shows: Detailed technical error for developer debugging

**Relay Publishing**:
- Unlikely all relays will fail (6 high-reliability relays)
- Show progress: "Publishing to relays (X of Y successful)"
- Partial success: "Published to X of Y relays - product is live"

**Signer Failures**:
- No publishing if signer fails/disconnects
- Clear message: "Signer disconnected - please reconnect and try again"
- Show exactly where failure occurred in the process

**Success Feedback**:
- Clear success message with event ID
- Provide njump link to view the event on Nostr
- Show "Product is now live in the shop" confirmation
- Refresh shop page to show the new product

**Network Issues**:
- Auto-retry for temporary network issues
- Clear "Connection lost" message if persistent
- Manual retry button for user-initiated retry

### Proof of Functionality - End-to-End Verification
**Product Creation Proof**:
- Show event ID after successful creation
- Provide njump link to view the event on Nostr
- Verify product appears in shop after creation

**Image Upload Proof**:
- Show Blossom URL after successful upload
- Verify image loads in product card
- Confirm file hash matches event tags

**Relay Publishing Proof**:
- Show relay status (X of Y successful)
- Provide event verification link
- Confirm event is discoverable on Nostr

**Page Refresh Behavior**:
- Products reload from relays on refresh
- Maintain user state and signer connection
- Show loading states during data fetch

**Product Updates/Revisions**:
- Show revision history when needed
- Allow editing via Kind 23 revisions
- Maintain product continuity with same identifier

### MVP & Testing Strategy - Piece by Piece Implementation
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
- Create 1 product with image
- Upload 1 image to Blossom
- Publish to 1 relay (minimum success)
- Show product in shop

**Critical Path That Must Work**:
- Signer detection → form → image upload → event creation → relay publishing → shop display

**Testing Strategy - Build & Test Each Piece**:
- Phase 1: Test signer detection first
- Phase 2: Test image upload to Blossom
- Phase 3: Test event creation and publishing
- Phase 4: Test products show in shop

**Proof of Success for Each Phase**:
- Phase 1: Signer works (detected and can sign)
- Phase 2: Image uploads to Blossom (get URL and hash)
- Phase 3: Events publish to relays (get event ID and njump link)
- Phase 4: Products show in shop (verify end-to-end functionality)

### Event Structure (Kind 23)

## Implementation Confidence

**Confidence Level: 9/10** ⬆️

**High Confidence Because**:
- ✅ **Blossom API is concrete** - Real endpoints, authentication, and production usage
- ✅ **Protocol is mature** - Already integrated in Primal 2.2+, 206 stars, actively maintained
- ✅ **Authentication is simple** - Kind 24242 signed events, no complex auth flows
- ✅ **File addressing is clear** - SHA-256 hash-based, exactly as designed
- ✅ **Redundancy is built-in** - Mirroring support for censorship resistance
- ✅ **Production ready** - Real-world testing already done by Primal users

**Remaining Uncertainty (1 point)**:
- ⚠️ **End-to-end integration** - Need to test complete flow from signer → Blossom → relays → shop
- ⚠️ **Real-world testing** - Need to verify Kind 23 + Blossom integration works as designed

## Notes

- **Fresh implementation** - No dependencies on existing code
- **Standardized approach** - Reusable patterns for other features
- **Protocol-native** - Built for Nostr, not adapted to it
- **User sovereignty** - Users own their data completely
- **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
- **Production-ready protocols** - Blossom and Nostr are mature and battle-tested

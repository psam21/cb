# Sign-Up Flow Specification

**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Architecture**: SOA-Compliant (6-layer pattern)  
**Dependencies**: 
- Sign-in refactoring should be completed first (see `tech-debt-signin-soa-violation.md`)
- ProfileBusinessService (exists - shared with sign-in for profile operations)
- Sign-up creates AuthBusinessService (NEW) for key management orchestration

**Related**: 
- Sign-in uses ProfileBusinessService directly (fetch existing profile)
- Sign-up uses AuthBusinessService ‚Üí ProfileBusinessService (publish new profile)
- ProfileBusinessService is SHARED by both authentication flows

---

## Implementation Overview

4-step sign-up flow for new Nostr users. Profile data collected first (Step 1), then keys generated and complete Kind 0 published (Step 2), backup/storage (Step 3), confirmation (Step 4).

**Key Points**:
- Name is mandatory
- Avatar and bio are optional
- Avatar held as File object until keys exist (Step 2)
- Only localStorage storage (encrypted)
- No QR codes, no NIP-05
- Complete Kind 0 published in Step 2 (not minimal)

---

## User Flow

```
Step 1: Profile Setup (SHOWN FIRST)
  - Display name (MANDATORY)
  - Avatar (OPTIONAL - held as File)
  - Bio (OPTIONAL)
  ‚Üì
Step 2: Key Generation + Publishing
  - Generate keys using GenericNostrService
  - Store npub in Zustand state
  - **Store nsec in Zustand (in-memory, never persisted)**
  - Create temporary NostrSigner from nsec
  - Display generated nsec/npub
  ‚Üì
Step 3: Backup + Storage
  - Download encrypted backup file
  - Automatic localStorage (encrypted)
  ‚Üì
Step 4: Final Confirmation
  - Security acknowledgment
  - Redirect to home/profile
```

## Architecture & Files

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Compliance

The sign-up flow follows Culture Bridge's strict 6-layer SOA pattern:

```
Page (signup/page.tsx)
  ‚Üì
Component (SignUpFlow.tsx)
  ‚Üì
Hook (useNostrSignUp.ts)
  ‚Üì
Business Service (AuthBusinessService.ts) [NEW]

#### 2. **Sign-In Page**

- **Path**: `/src/app/signin/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Add "Sign Up" link/button to redirect to `/signup`
- **Note**: Sign-in page already refactored to SOA-compliant architecture

#### 3. **Auth Store** [MODIFIED]
- **Path**: `/src/stores/useAuthStore.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY ADDED: `nsec: string | null` field (in-memory only)
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY ADDED: `setNsec(nsec)` action
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY CONFIGURED: nsec excluded from persist (never saved to localStorage)
  - ‚úÖ ALREADY CONFIGURED: nsec cleared on logout and reset
- **No additional changes needed** - auth store is ready for sign-up flow
  - Persist `isNewUser` temporarily (clear after first session)

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Key Generation Flow

**Using `nostr-tools` Library** (already in `package.json` v2.17.0)

```
Step 1: Generate Private Key
- Function: generateSecretKey() from nostr-tools
- Output: Uint8Array (32 bytes of cryptographically secure randomness)
- Conversion: Buffer.from(secretKey).toString('hex')

Step 2: Derive Public Key
- Function: getPublicKey(secretKey) from nostr-tools
- Input: Secret key (hex string or Uint8Array)
- Output: Public key (64-character hex string)

Step 3: Encode Keys (NIP-19)
- Private Key: nip19.nsecEncode(secretKey) ‚Üí "nsec1..."
- Public Key: nip19.npubEncode(publicKey) ‚Üí "npub1..."

Step 4: Validation
- Verify nsec decodes back to original secret key
- Verify npub decodes to public key
- Check key lengths (nsec: 63 chars, npub: 63 chars)
```

**Security Considerations**:

- Keys generated in browser memory (never sent to server)
- Use `crypto.getRandomValues()` for entropy (via nostr-tools)
- Clear keys from memory after storage/export
- No key derivation from weak passwords (full randomness)

### 2. Key Storage

**Storage Method**: Browser localStorage via Zustand persist middleware

**What Gets Stored (persisted to localStorage)**:
- User profile data (pubkey, npub, profile) - same as sign-in
- `isAuthenticated` flag

**What Gets Stored (in-memory only, NOT persisted)**:
- `nsec` - held in Zustand state during sign-up flow
- Used for creating temporary signer for avatar upload and profile publishing
- Cleared on page refresh or logout
- Never displayed in UI

**Implementation**:
- Use same Zustand persist middleware as sign-in (existing pattern)
- Store only non-sensitive user data in localStorage
- Store nsec in AuthState (excluded from partialize function)
- After successful sign-up, user MUST either:
  1. Download backup file (contains nsec) for manual storage, OR
  2. Import nsec into browser extension immediately
- If user loses backup file AND clears browser data, they lose access permanently

**Security**:
- No encryption needed (nsec never stored in browser)
- Same storage pattern as existing sign-in flow
- User responsible for securing backup file

### 3. Profile Creation (Kind 0 Event)

**Metadata Structure** (Nostr Kind 0):

```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "pubkey": "<user's npub in hex>",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "tags": [],
  "content": JSON.stringify({
    "name": "Display Name",
    "display_name": "Display Name",
    "about": "User bio (optional)",
    "picture": "https://blossom.example.com/<hash>",
    "banner": "",
    "lud16": "",
    "website": ""
  })
}
```

**Publishing Flow**:

```
Step 2: KeyGenerationStep
  ‚Üì
  [User clicks "Generate Keys"]
  ‚Üì
useNostrSignUp.generateKeys()
  ‚Üì
AuthBusinessService.generateNostrKeys()
  ‚Üì
AuthBusinessService.publishProfile(profile) ‚ö° BACKGROUND
  ‚Üì
ProfileBusinessService.publishProfile(profile, temporarySigner)
  ‚Üì
ProfileBusinessService.createProfileEvent() [creates Kind 0 event]
  ‚Üì
GenericEventService.signEvent() [signs with temporarySigner]
  ‚Üì
GenericRelayService.publishEvent() [publishes to relays]
  ‚Üì
AuthBusinessService.publishWelcomeNote(temporarySigner) ‚ö° BACKGROUND (SILENT)
  ‚Üì
Creates Kind 1 text note with welcome message + hashtags
  ‚Üì
GenericEventService.signEvent() [signs with temporarySigner]
  ‚Üì
GenericRelayService.publishEvent() [publishes to relays]

Note: 
- temporarySigner is created from nsec stored in Zustand
- Implements NostrSigner interface
- ProfileBusinessService.publishProfile() is SHARED with sign-in
- No NostrEventService needed (ProfileBusinessService handles Kind 0 directly)
- Welcome note (Kind 1) verifies signer works for text notes, not shown to user
```

**Avatar Upload**:
- Reuse existing `ImageUpload` + `ImageCropper` components from `/src/components/profile/`
- 1:1 aspect ratio for profile picture
- Upload to Blossom via `GenericBlossomService.uploadFile()`
- Requires temporary signer created from nsec stored in Zustand
- AuthBusinessService orchestrates: generate keys ‚Üí store nsec in Zustand ‚Üí create signer ‚Üí upload avatar ‚Üí publish profile

### 4. Key Backup Mechanisms

#### Plain Text Backup File

**Format**: Simple text file with clear warning

```text
CULTURE BRIDGE - NOSTR IDENTITY BACKUP
=======================================

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: NEVER SHARE THIS FILE WITH ANYONE! ‚ö†Ô∏è

This file contains your Nostr identity - think of it like your ID and password combined.
If someone gets access to this file, they can impersonate you on the Nostr network.

Keep this file safe and private!

---

Your Public Key (npub):
npub1...

Your Private Key (nsec):
nsec1...

Culture Bridge URL:
https://culturebridge.vercel.app

---

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
- Your nsec is like a password that can NEVER be changed
- Anyone with your nsec can post as you on ALL Nostr apps
- Store this file in a secure location (encrypted drive, password manager, etc.)
- Never send this file via email, chat, or upload it anywhere
- If you lose this file AND your browser data, you lose your identity permanently

For support (DO NOT share your keys):
Visit: https://culturebridge.vercel.app/support
```

**File Download**:
- Trigger via `<a>` tag with `download` attribute
- Filename: `{display_name}_culturebridge.txt`
- MIME type: `text/plain`
- No encryption (user responsible for secure storage)

---

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **XSS Attack** | Never store plaintext nsec in localStorage; use encryption + HttpOnly cookies (not applicable for client-side apps) |
| **Key Logging** | Warn users about keyloggers; recommend browser extensions for key isolation |
| **Phishing** | Educate users that NO legitimate Nostr app asks for nsec via form submission |
| **Lost Keys** | Mandatory backup confirmation; display multiple warnings; no recovery mechanism |
| **Browser Extension Compromise** | Out of scope (user responsibility to vet extensions) |
| **Network Interception** | Keys never transmitted over network; all operations client-side |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Key Generation**
   - Use cryptographically secure random number generation (`crypto.getRandomValues()`)
   - Never derive keys from user passwords (full entropy required)
   - Validate key format after generation (decode/encode round-trip)

2. **Key Display**
   - Blur nsec by default (click to reveal)
   - Copy-to-clipboard with automatic clear after 30 seconds
   - Warn user to clear clipboard manually
   - Never log keys to console (even in development)

3. **Key Backup**
   - Backup file contains plain text nsec (user responsible for security)
   - Clear warnings in backup file about never sharing nsec
   - User must download and secure backup file themselves
   - No cloud storage or transmission of backup file

4. **User Education**
   - Display warning: "Your private key IS your account. There is no password reset."
   - Explain: "This key works across ALL Nostr apps (Damus, Snort, Primal, etc.)"
   - Recommend: "Install a browser extension (Alby, nos2x) for secure key management"
   - Emphasize: "Back up your key NOW. We cannot recover it for you."

## User Experience (UX) Guidelines

### Step-by-Step Wizard

**Progress Indicator**: 4 steps total

1. Profile Setup (Name MANDATORY, Avatar/Bio OPTIONAL - shown first)
2. Key Generation (Display nsec/npub + Upload avatar + Publish complete Kind 0)
3. Backup + Local Storage (Download encrypted file + Automatic localStorage)
4. Final Confirmation (Security acknowledgment)

**Navigation**:

- "Back" button available on steps 2-5 (returns to previous step)
- "Next" button enabled only when step requirements met:
  - Step 3: Backup confirmed via checkbox
  - Step 4: Display name entered (minimum requirement)
- "Cancel" button available on all steps (returns to `/signin` with confirmation dialog)

**Visual Design**:

- Large, clear security warnings (red background, white text)
- Green checkmarks for completed steps
- Copy-to-clipboard icons next to nsec/npub
- Download buttons with file icons
- Background publishing indicator in Step 2 (spinner or "Publishing your profile...")
- Required field indicators (asterisk) for display name in Step 1

**Key Flow Changes**:

- **Step 1**: Profile form (name mandatory, avatar/bio optional) - shown first before key generation
- **Step 2**: Keys are generated, avatar uploaded (if provided), complete Kind 0 profile published (not minimal)
- **Step 3**: Backup + automatic localStorage storage (no choice of storage method)
- **Step 4**: Final confirmation before redirect to home or profile

### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | User Message | Recovery Action |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Key generation fails | "Failed to generate keys. Please refresh and try again." | Retry button |
| Background profile publish fails (Step 2) | "Profile publishing in progress... May take a few moments." | Non-blocking - allow user to continue, retry in background |
| Backup not confirmed (Step 3) | "You must back up your keys before continuing." | Disable "Next" until checkbox checked |
| Display name missing (Step 1) | "Display name is required to continue." | Disable "Next" until name entered |
| Avatar upload fails (Step 4) | "Avatar upload failed. You can add it later in your profile." | Allow continue without avatar |
| Profile update fails (Step 4) | "Profile update failed. Your basic profile is still published." | Show error but allow continue |
| Relay publishing fails | "Profile published to {X} of {Y} relays. Some relays are unavailable." | Show partial success, allow continue |

### Accessibility (A11y)

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- **Focus Management**: Auto-focus on "Next" button when step completes
- **Skip Links**: "Skip to profile setup" for users who don't need backup explanations
- **High Contrast**: Security warnings visible in high contrast mode
- **Large Text**: Key display uses monospace font, minimum 14px

## Integration Points

### Existing Components to Reuse

1. **Profile Image Upload**
   - Component: `/src/components/profile/ImageUpload.tsx`
   - Purpose: Avatar selection during profile setup
   - Modifications: None required (already compatible)

2. **Image Cropper**
   - Component: `/src/components/profile/ImageCropper.tsx`
   - Purpose: 1:1 aspect ratio cropping for avatar
   - Modifications: None required

3. **Auth Button**
   - Component: `/src/components/auth/AuthButton.tsx`
   - Purpose: Display sign-up link when not authenticated
   - Modifications: Add conditional sign-up button

4. **Loading Spinner**
   - Component: `/src/components/generic/LoadingSpinner.tsx`
   - Purpose: Display during key generation, profile publishing
   - Modifications: None required

### Existing Services to Leverage

1. **ProfileBusinessService** (SHARED with sign-in)
   - Methods: `validateProfile()`, `createProfileEvent()`, `publishProfile()`
   - Purpose: Create and publish Kind 0 metadata event
   - Modifications: None required (already compatible)
   - Usage: AuthBusinessService delegates profile publishing to ProfileBusinessService

2. **GenericBlossomService**
   - Method: `uploadFile()`
   - Purpose: Upload avatar to Blossom CDN during sign-up
   - Modifications: None required (already accepts NostrSigner)
   - Usage: AuthBusinessService creates temporary signer from generated nsec, passes to uploadFile()
   - Note: Temporary signer implements NostrSigner interface using generated keys

3. **Auth Store**
   - Methods: `setUser()`, `setAuthenticated()`
   - Purpose: Store pubkey and profile after sign-up
   - Modifications: Add `setNewUser(true)` flag
   - Usage: Called by useNostrSignUp hook after successful sign-up

---

## Post-Sign-Up Flow

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Welcome Modal**
   - Display: "Welcome to Culture Bridge, {display_name}!"
   - Explain: "Your Nostr identity is now active across the multiple relays on the network."
   - Show: Quick tutorial (Explore, Shop, Heritage, Messages)
   - CTA: "Start exploring"

2. **First Session Recommendations**
   - Redirect to `/explore` to see public content
   - Show tooltip on "Profile" menu item: "Complete your profile"
   - Show tooltip on "Messages": "Connect with other users"
   - Show tooltip on "Contribute": "Share your heritage"

### Browser Extension Migration

**If user chose localStorage but later installs extension**:

1. Detect extension installation (check `window.nostr` on page load)
2. Show migration prompt: "We detected a Nostr extension. Move your keys for better security?"
3. If accepted:
   - Guide user to export nsec from localStorage
   - Import nsec into extension
   - Clear nsec from localStorage
   - Update auth flow to use extension
4. If declined:
   - Show "Don't ask again" option
   - Continue using localStorage

```
Page ‚Üí Component ‚Üí Hook ‚Üí Business Service ‚Üí Event Service ‚Üí Generic Service
```

‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**:
- Components calling services directly
- Hooks creating Nostr events
- Pages with business logic
- Key generation outside AuthBusinessService

### Security Reminders

Design a beautiful, highly functional, and culturally respectful 12-page website for ‚ÄúCulture Bridge ‚Äì Heritage Preservation Network‚Äù, a decentralized platform built on Nostr to permanently preserve cultural practices, languages, and traditions. The platform empowers indigenous and minority communities to self-document their heritage without institutional or corporate control.

This website should reflect values of sovereignty, storytelling, intergenerational knowledge, and digital resilience ‚Äî combining modern technology (like AR and decentralized protocols) with timeless traditions.

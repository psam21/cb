# Culture Bridge Technical Development Roadmap üõ†Ô∏è

*Technically-focused development plan prioritizing infrastructure, dependencies, and proper separation of concerns*

---

## üìã **Project Overview & Context**

### What is Culture Bridge?

Culture Bridge is a decentralized heritage preservation platform built on Nostr protocol, designed to permanently preserve cultural practices, languages, and traditions. The platform empowers indigenous and minority communities to self-document their heritage without institutional or corporate control.

**Core Mission**: Preserve cultural heritage through decentralized, community-controlled digital infrastructure while respecting cultural sovereignty and traditional knowledge protocols.

### Technical Architecture Overview

## üìö **Technology Glossary & Dependencies**

### Core Technologies Explained

**Next.js 14**: React framework for production web applications with features like:
- App Router: Modern routing system with layouts and nested routes
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality
- Automatic code splitting and optimization

**TypeScript**: JavaScript with static type definitions for:
- Better code quality and fewer runtime errors
- Enhanced IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- Self-documenting code through type annotations
- Better collaboration in team environments

**Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework providing:
- Consistent design system with predefined classes
- Responsive design utilities for mobile-first development
- Dark mode support and theming capabilities
- Smaller bundle sizes through unused CSS elimination

**Nostr Protocol**: Decentralized social networking protocol that enables:
- Censorship-resistant content publishing
- User-owned identity and data
- Relay-based message distribution
- Cryptographic signatures for content authenticity
- **Large file storage through NIP-94/NIP-96** (File metadata and HTTP storage integration)
- **Media handling** for images, video, audio, and documents

**Simplified Storage Architecture**: Instead of using IPFS, Nostr can handle all storage needs:
- **Small data**: Directly in Nostr events (text, metadata, small images)
- **Large files**: Using NIP-96 HTTP File Storage Integration with NIP-94 metadata
- **Media files**: Images, videos, audio through Nostr file storage servers
- **Content addressing**: SHA-256 hashes for file identification and integrity

### Why These Technologies Were Chosen

1. **Next.js**: Provides full-stack capabilities while maintaining excellent developer experience and performance
2. **TypeScript**: Ensures code quality and maintainability as the project scales
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development while maintaining design consistency
4. **Nostr**: Perfect alignment with cultural sovereignty goals - handles both social networking AND file storage
5. **NIP-96 File Storage**: Eliminates IPFS complexity while maintaining decentralized file storage with content addressing

### Architectural Benefits of Nostr-First Approach

**Simplified Tech Stack**: Instead of managing both Nostr + IPFS, we use Nostr for everything:
- **Event data**: Social features, metadata, small content
- **File storage**: Images, videos, documents via NIP-96 servers  
- **Content addressing**: SHA-256 hashes for all content integrity
- **Unified identity**: Single key pair for all platform interactions

**Better Cultural Fit**: 
- **Community Control**: Communities can run their own Nostr relays and file servers
- **Data Sovereignty**: No external dependencies on IPFS network or third-party providers
- **Simpler Migration**: Moving between Nostr relays is easier than IPFS migrations
- **Cost Effective**: Communities can choose storage providers or run their own

### Technical Dependencies Chain

```
Phase Dependencies:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1 (Foundation) ‚Üí All subsequent phases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2 (Dev Tools) ‚Üí Required for quality development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3 (Database/APIs) ‚Üí Required for Phases 4-11
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 4 (Security) ‚Üí Required before user data handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5 (Decentralization) ‚Üí Builds on Phase 3 APIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 6 (Search/AI) ‚Üí Requires Phases 3-5 complete
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phases 7+ ‚Üí Sequential building on previous foundations
```

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
- Database setup must complete before user authentication
- Authentication required before user-generated content
- File storage needed before media upload features
- Security framework required before handling sensitive cultural data
- Nostr integration depends on stable API layer
- All backend services must exist before mobile app development

### Architecture Decisions & Reasoning

**Why Phase-Based Development?**
- Ensures each system has the dependencies it needs to function properly
- Allows for thorough testing of each layer before adding complexity
- Reduces technical debt by building proper foundations first
- Enables team members to specialize in different layers

**Database-First Backend Approach:**
- Cultural data has complex relationships (languages, regions, practices, communities)
- Proper schema design prevents data inconsistencies later
- Migration system allows evolution without data loss
- Multiple storage types (SQL for metadata, IPFS for media, Nostr for decentralized data)

**Security and Privacy by Design:**
- Cultural data is sensitive and requires special protection
- Indigenous data sovereignty principles must be built into the architecture
- Privacy controls need to be granular (community, family, individual levels)
- Encryption and access controls must be established before storing real data

**Decentralization Strategy:**
- **Pure Nostr approach**: All decentralized features through Nostr ecosystem
- **Community empowerment**: Communities can run their own relays and file servers
- **Unified storage**: NIP-96 file storage integrates seamlessly with Nostr events  
- **Simplified architecture**: No complex IPFS/Nostr hybrid - just Nostr everywhere
- **Gradual adoption**: Communities can start with hosted solutions, then self-host when ready

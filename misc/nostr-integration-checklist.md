**Key Principles:**
1. **Cultural sovereignty** takes precedence over technical features
2. **Elder accessibility** guides all interface decisions  
3. **Community ownership** shapes all data architecture choices
4. **Permanent preservation** drives all storage decisions
5. **Respectful sharing** informs all privacy and permission systems

**Next Actions:**
1. Review checklist with development team
2. Validate cultural requirements with community advisors
3. Begin Phase 2 foundation work
4. Establish Nostr development environment

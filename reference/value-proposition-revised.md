# Culture Bridge: Decentralizing Cultural Preservation  
**Funding Request:** $750,000 USD (staged: $250k + $250k + $250k) | **Duration:** 18 months | **Impact:** Systemic challenge to centralized cultural control

## The Challenge: Culture at the Mercy of Algorithms

Centralized platforms control what is seen, shared, and remembered. Sacred knowledge can be erased by:
- Corporate censorship  
- Algorithmic downranking  
- Server shutdowns and platform exits  
- Data ownership locked away from the communities it belongs to  

Culture Bridge is the first platform to **permanently decentralize cultural heritage using the Nostr protocol**, ensuring **elders’ voices and community stories cannot be silenced or buried**.

## Our Disruption Model: Measurable Anti-Censorship Wins

We don’t just aim to “preserve culture” — we aim to **prove a censorship-resistant alternative works in practice**.

**Every Impact Drop is a public demonstration of disruption:**
1. Cultural archives published on Nostr that remain accessible despite platform takedown attempts.  
2. Verified elder identities on a decentralized network that centralized platforms can’t impersonate or suspend.  
3. Community-run relays hosting cultural materials without relying on corporate infrastructure.

## Phase-by-Phase Cultural & Technical Goals

| Phase | Cultural Milestone | Technical Milestone | Disruption Proof |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Impact Drop 1 | 10 communities, 3 endangered languages, 100 elder stories | Immutable archives, taxonomy search | Content remains live after centralized takedown |
| Impact Drop 2 | 30 communities, 10 endangered languages, 300 elder stories | Verified elder IDs, moderation tools | Elders publish content even if blocked on other platforms |
| Impact Drop 3 | 60 communities, 20 endangered languages, governance plan | Educational modules, API, analytics | Institutional cultural archive published entirely via Nostr |

# Culture Bridge Backlog: Nostr Integration Roadmap

Purpose: A structured backlog- End-to-end user flows implemented per page: list ‚Üí filter/sort/search ‚Üí detail ‚Üí back preserves list state; media playback and downloads work; loading/empty/error states present.

## Gap Analysis & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Addressed Gaps

1. **Content Sensitivity (E11)** - Moved to Iteration 1 since it affects all content display from discovery onwards
2. **Home Page Dependencies** - Updated E8 to depend on curation lists (E12) for meaningful featured content
3. **Contribute Flow Context** - Updated E16 to depend on discovery epics (E5, E6, E7) so users understand what to contribute
4. **Community Event References** - Updated E14 to depend on cultural content (E5) since events often reference cultures
5. **Profile Content Aggregation** - Updated E13 to depend on content epics for meaningful profile displays
6. **Iteration-Phase Alignment** - Cleaned up phase assignments to follow logical progression
7. **Footer Pages & Features** - Added E27 (Static Pages), E28 (Support System), E29 (Newsletter & Social Integration) to cover all footer links and functionality
8. **Missing Page Coverage** - About Us, Get Involved, Support section, Newsletter, Social media, Contact system now properly mapped

### üîç Remaining Considerations

1. **User Onboarding Flow** - Consider explicit onboarding guidance in E8 (Home) to help users navigate from landing to discovery
2. **Empty State Handling** - Ensure graceful degradation when featured content or metrics are unavailable in early iterations
3. **Content Bootstrapping** - May need seed content strategy for meaningful home page display before user-generated content exists
4. **Cross-Epic Dependencies** - Monitor circular dependencies as epics evolve (E8‚ÜíE12‚ÜíE1, E5 content for home features)
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Consider how features degrade gracefully when advanced epics aren't yet implemented

### üìã Implementation Recommendations

1. **Iteration 2 (Home)** - Implement fallback content and empty states for when discovery content isn't yet robust
2. **Iteration 3 (Discovery)** - Prioritize content seeding strategy alongside E5 implementation  
3. **Iteration 6 (Contribute)** - Include user guidance about contribution types learned from exploration
4. **Cross-Iteration** - Maintain feature flags to gracefully handle incomplete dependency chains

## Epics, Stories, and Tasks

Each epic lists: motivation, NIPs, dependencies, affected files, acceptance criteria, and stories with concrete tasks.

### Epic E0: Global UI Flow Foundation

- Motivation: Turn demo pages into production-grade flows with URL-driven state and consistent UX patterns.
- NIPs: n/a (UX foundation)
- Dependencies: None
- Affected files: `src/app/*`, `src/components/pages/*`, shared UI hooks/utilities.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Filters, search, and sort are encoded in URL query params; back/forward restores state and scroll position.
  - List pages implement pagination or infinite scroll with stable loading placeholders.
  - Each route has `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` with consistent skeletons and empty states.
  - Debounced search input and cancelable requests for lists with search.
- Stories
  - S1: URL state and deep-linking
    - Tasks
      - T1: Build `useQueryParamState` hook for filter/sort/search
      - T2: Preserve list scroll position across navigation
  - S2: Loading, empty, and error patterns
    - Tasks
      - T3: Add `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` to routes missing them; unify Skeletons/Empty components
  - S3: Pagination / infinite scroll
    - Tasks
      - T4: Create base pagination/virtual list hook; wire to Exhibitions and Resources
  - S4: Search wiring
    - Tasks
      - T5: Debounced search input component; integrate with list queries

## Notes

- Preserve visual design; implement missing user flows as first-class work. Current pages are demo-only and many flows are non-functional.
- Keep UI consistent; flip data via a feature flag. Fallback to existing mocks when disabled.
- Map all work to referenced NIPs to preserve protocol rationale.
- Use suggested labels: area/*, type/*, page/*, nip/*, phase/*, priority/*.
- Align with `reference/user-flows.md`: each page has explicit search, filter, load-more, and CTA navigation flows.
- **Top-down integration**: Requirements from `reference/user-flows.md` "Typical Requirements for a Cultural Bridge Platform" are systematically integrated into epics, ensuring comprehensive feature coverage across all 8 requirement categories.

## Iterations (timeboxes)

- Iteration 1 (Phase 1): Foundation infrastructure ‚Äì Flow foundation + Data backbone + Media + Labels + Content sensitivity (E0, E1, E2, E3, E11)
- Iteration 2 (Phase 1): Home + Navigation ‚Äì Landing page metrics, featured content, curation lists, and navigation flows (E8, E12)
- Iteration 3 (Phase 2): Core discovery ‚Äì Explore cultures (primary user journey from home) (E5)
- Iteration 4 (Phase 2): Supporting content ‚Äì Resources/Downloads + Elder Voices + Reactions (E6, E7, E17)
- Iteration 5 (Phase 2): User system ‚Äì Identity/Authentication for contribution flows (E10)
- Iteration 6 (Phase 3): Content creation ‚Äì Contribute flows (users understand what to contribute after exploring) (E16)
- Iteration 7 (Phase 3): Community foundations ‚Äì User profiles, messaging, moderation, events (E13, E20, E26, E14)
- Iteration 8 (Phase 3): Advanced features ‚Äì Exhibitions + Language learning + Educational tools (E4, E9, E23)
- Iteration 9 (Phase 3): Specialized features ‚Äì Exchange + Payments + Analytics + Infrastructure (E15, E18, E19, E22, E21, E24, E25)
- Iteration 10 (Phase 3): Platform completion ‚Äì Static pages, Support system, Newsletter, Social integration (E27, E28, E29)

## User Journey Rationale

The iteration structure follows the natural user journey and website navigation:

1. **Foundation (Iteration 1)** - Essential infrastructure including content sensitivity handling
   - Users need functional data layers, media resolution, and content safety from the start

2. **Home Landing (Iteration 2)** - Entry point with clear navigation paths  
   - Users land on home ‚Üí see stats, mission, featured content ‚Üí get oriented to the platform
   - Curation lists enable meaningful featured content display

3. **Core Discovery (Iteration 3)** - Primary user journey from home
   - Users click "Explore Cultures" ‚Üí primary discovery experience
   - This is the main value proposition and should work end-to-end early

4. **Supporting Content (Iteration 4)** - Content that enriches discovery
   - Users discover Resources and Elder Voices ‚Üí supporting content types
   - Reactions system enables engagement with elder stories

5. **User System (Iteration 5)** - Authentication preparation
   - Users want to Contribute ‚Üí needs identity/auth system first
   - Clean separation between anonymous discovery and authenticated actions

6. **Content Creation (Iteration 6)** - Users become contributors
   - Users understand platform value and content types from exploration (E5, E6, E7)
   - Can contribute meaningfully with context of what exists

7. **Community Features (Iteration 7)** - Social engagement
   - Users engage with Community ‚Üí profiles, messaging, events, moderation
   - Community events can reference cultural content discovered earlier

8. **Advanced Features (Iteration 8)** - Secondary navigation items
   - Users explore advanced features ‚Üí exhibitions, language learning
   - Exhibitions are curatorial (more complex than basic discovery)

9. **Specialized Features (Iteration 9)** - Optional/advanced capabilities
   - Exchange, payments, analytics, infrastructure scaling

10. **Platform Completion (Iteration 10)** - Supporting pages and community features
    - About/static pages, support system, newsletter, social media integration

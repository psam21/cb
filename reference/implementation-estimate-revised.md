# **Project:** Culture Bridge – Staged Implementation Plan for a Nostr-based Cultural Heritage Platform  
**Date:** August 13, 2025 (Revised for Staged Delivery)  
**Team Size:** 6.5–7.0 FTE  
**Duration:** 18 months total (with phased funding gates)  
**Total Target Budget:** $750,000 USD (raised in 2–3 tranches)  

---

## Executive Summary

Culture Bridge is a mission-driven cultural preservation platform built on the Nostr protocol. Our goal is to **undermine centralized, algorithm-driven control** of cultural content by creating a censorship-resistant, community-owned archive for elders, practitioners, and communities.

**Key Change in Approach:**  
Instead of an all-or-nothing 18-month build, we will deliver **progressive “Impact Drops” every 4–6 months** — each proving both cultural and technical disruption. This de-risks funding, accelerates visibility, and ensures each milestone builds trust with funders and communities.

## Funding & Timeline Model

| Phase | Duration | Budget | Goals | Risk Profile |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Impact Drop 1 – Cultural Records & Discovery MVP** | 6–8 months | $250,000 | First communities onboarded, cultural taxonomy live, immutable archives published on Nostr, censorship-resistance demo | Medium |
| **Impact Drop 2 – Community Creation & Contribution Tools** | +6 months | $250,000 | Secure content contribution flows, verified elder accounts, community moderation in action | Medium–Low |
| **Impact Drop 3 – Advanced Preservation & Governance** | +6 months | $250,000 | Educational modules, public API, institutional partnerships, governance transition plan | Low |

## Phased Milestones & Deliverables

### **Impact Drop 1: Cultural Records & Discovery MVP** (Months 1–8)
**Budget:** $250,000 | **Focus:** Disruption Proof-of-Concept

- **Tech:** Immutable cultural archives (NIP-33/23), basic taxonomy (NIP-68/12), relay redundancy for reliability  
- **Cultural:** 10 communities onboarded, 3 endangered languages documented, 100 elder stories published  
- **Disruption Demonstration:** Example of cultural content remaining accessible despite simulated platform censorship  

---

### **Impact Drop 2: Community Creation & Contribution Tools** (Months 9–14)
**Budget:** $250,000 | **Focus:** Community Autonomy

- **Tech:** Secure contribution flows (NIP-98), verified elder identity (NIP-05/26), moderation tools (NIP-56)  
- **Cultural:** 30+ communities, 10+ endangered languages, 300+ elder stories  
- **Disruption Demonstration:** Verified elder accounts resisting impersonation on centralized platforms  

---

### **Impact Drop 3: Advanced Preservation & Governance** (Months 15–18)
**Budget:** $250,000 | **Focus:** Institutional Integration

- **Tech:** Educational modules (E23), public API (E25), analytics (E22)  
- **Cultural:** 60+ communities, 20+ endangered languages, governance plan for community ownership  
- **Disruption Demonstration:** Institutional partnership publishing cultural materials to Nostr-based network  

---

## Key Risk Adjustments
- **Protocol volatility:** Early involvement in NIP development  
- **Community onboarding:** Staggered onboarding to manage trust-building workload  
- **Relay dependence:** Multi-relay strategy to avoid single point of failure

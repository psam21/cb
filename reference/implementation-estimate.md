## Timeline Options & Budget Analysis

**Recommended Timeline: 18 months ($750,000)**
- Balanced approach allowing thorough development and testing
- Proper community engagement and cultural validation
- Sufficient time for Nostr protocol integration complexity
- Full-featured team with dedicated roles

**Accelerated Timeline: 12 months ($500,000)**
- Risk: Rushed cultural validation and community building
- Limited time for complex NIP integration and testing
- May compromise quality and cultural sensitivity requirements

**Extended Timeline: 24 months ($1,000,000)**
- Allows for extensive community partnership development
- More thorough internationalization and accessibility features
- Additional buffer for protocol evolution and technical challenges
